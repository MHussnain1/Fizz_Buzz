FizzBuzz is a popular programming exercise often used in coding interviews and as a 
beginner-friendly task to practice logic and iteration. The task involves printing a 
sequence of numbers, but with specific substitutions based on divisibility rules.

The Rules of FizzBuzz
Print numbers from 1 to N (N is usually a given limit).
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
